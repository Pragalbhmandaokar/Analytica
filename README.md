## Use Cases

- **User Behavior Analysis** - Understand how users interact with your site, and how they use your site to achieve their
  goals.
- **Track User Journeys** - Track the user journeys from the moment they land on your site, to the moment they leave.

## Live Demo

## Installation
AutoCapture.js is still in development, right now it is in the alpha stage, and it is not ready for production use.

### NPM

```bash
npm install autocapture
```

### CDN

```html

<script src='https://unpkg.com/autocapture.js'></script>
```

### Importing library

You can import the library in your project using the following:

```javascript
import { AutoCapture } from 'autoCapture';
```

And to install internal plugins, you can import the plugins in your project using the following:

```javascript
import { ScrollPlugin, MouseMovementPlugin, PageViewPlugin } from 'autoCapture';

AutoCapture.use(new ScrollPlugin());
AutoCapture.use(new MouseMovementPlugin());
AutoCapture.use(new PageViewPlugin());
```

However, you can use CDN to import the library's UMD build in a browser and start using it right away.

Note that the UMD build includes all the plugins, and you don't need to install them separately.

```html

<script src='https://unpkg.com/autocapture.js'></script>
```

### Usage

Using AutoCapture.js is very simple, now you just need to initialize the library with your preferred options.

```javascript
 const instance = new AutoCapture({
  safelist: ['input[type="password"]'],
  persistence: 'memory',
  capture: ['tap', 'form', 'page'],
  onEventCapture: (event) => {
    console.log('Event stored', event)

    // Send event to the server
    // ...
  }
})

instance.start()
```

**Simple as that** - AutoCapture.js will automatically capture all the user interactions on your site, from the moment
of installation forward.

### Notable Control Options

- **Safelist** - Safelist is a list of CSS selectors that you want to ignore. For example, you can ignore all the
  password inputs by adding `input[type="password"]` to the safelist.
- **Persistence** - Persistence is the way you want to store the captured events. You can choose between `memory`
  , `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` and `none`. `memory` is the default value.
  - `memory` - Events are stored in memory and are lost when the page is refreshed.
  - `localStorage` - Events are stored in the browser's local storage and are persisted across sessions.
  - `sessionStorage` - Events are stored in the browser's session storage and are lost when the browser is closed.
  - `none` - Events are not stored anywhere.
- **Capture** - Capture is the list of plugin name. You can choose between `tap`, `scroll`, `mouse-movement`, `page`
  , `video`, `form`, `swipe`. `tap`. But make sure you have installed the plugins you want to use.
- **onEventCapture** - onEventCapture is a callback function that will be called every time an event is captured. You
  can use this callback to send the captured events to your server.
  - You can use this callback to send the captured events to your server.
  - You can use this callback to persist the captured events in your own way.
  - You can use this callback to send the captured events to your own analytics tool.

## Sample Captured Events

```json
{
  "event": "click",
  "timestamp": "2022-11-03T19:04:22.538Z",
  "target": {
    "selector": "button",
    "attributes": {
      "text": "Click Me",
      "className": "btn btn-primary",
      "type": "button",
      "tagName": "BUTTON",
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "devicePixelRatio": 2,
    "isBot": false,
    "isMobile": false,
    "isTouch": false,
    "referrer": "",
    "screen": {
      "width": 1512,
      "height": 982
    },
    "window": {
      "width": 793,
      "height": 772
    },
    "scrollDepth": 0,
    "timestamp": 1665935720295,

```

Details fields are plugin specific. For example, the `form` plugin will add the form details to the `details` field.

## Extending AutoCapture.js

You can extend AutoCapture.js by creating a new plugin. A plugin is a class that extends the [PluginBuilder](
/src/core/core.plugin.ts) class.

```js
import { PluginBuilder } from 'autocapture.js';

class MyPlugin extends PluginBuilder {
  // Key is the name of the plugin and should be unique.
  // Also the key is the required parameter.
  key = 'some-new-plugin';

  /**
   *  Method to bind the event listener to the elements using the DOMEvent class.
   *  This method is required and should be implemented.
   */
  bind() {
    // This method is called when the plugin is initialized.
    // You can bind any event listeners here.

    // The importent thing is to return the array of objects with the following structure.
    return [
      {
        // The name of the event to added in payload. (Required)
        name: 'content-loaded',
        // The element to bind the event listener to. (Required)
        target: document,
        // The event to listen to. (Required)
        event: 'DOMContentLoaded',
        // The callback function to call when the event is triggered. (Required)
        callback: this._privateMethod,
        // The options to pass to the addEventListener method. (Optional)
        options: false,
        // The throttling time in milliseconds. (Optional)
        throttle: 1000,
        // The condition function to check if the event should be captured. (Optional)
        condition: (event) => true
      },
      // ... You can add more objects here.
    ]

  }

  /**
   * Your private methods.
   */
  _privateMethod() {
    // ...
    // your code here

    // your callback function should return an object that object will be passed to the event payload.
    return {
      'user-data': {
        id: 1,
        name: 'John Doe'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
